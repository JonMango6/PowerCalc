# PowerCalc
A calculator that can help determine your estimated one rep max on any compound lift.

Download the file "PowerCalc.exe" to use the calculator.

To use the calculator: 
1. Enter the lift measured in pounds in the first box 
2. Enter the number of repetitions performed in the second box.
3. Press Calculate.

The calculator should now tell you your estimated one rep max.

The accuracy of the result is heavily dependent on the athletes ability to percieve maximal exertion.

The two formulas used to produce the estimates are the Brzycki formula and the Epley formula.
All calculations done with under 8 repetitions are calculated using the Brzycki formula.
All calculations done with above 10 repetitions are done with the Epley formula.
Calculations that are done with either 8 or 9 repetitions are taken as an average of the two.
This is because the Brzycki formula is more accurate with lower repetitions and the Epley formula is more
accurate with higher repetitions.
